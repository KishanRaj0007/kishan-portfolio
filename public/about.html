<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hii there, Hii, this is Kishan. I am first year undergraduate student at NIT Allahabad pursuing bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. I am aspiring to be a competitive programmer.
  for which i am not working as required.
</p>

<p>I gave JEE exam in 2023, but unfortunatly i couldn't make it. Eventually with my mains rank i landed in MNNIT. Here i got a chance to make 
  new friends.
</p>
<p>
  They all are very unique. Firstly, the Professor of our room is Scientist sahab(Vansh) who always smiles and makes us too.
  He is really hardworking and dedicated towards his goals. I got to learn soo many things from him like i try to be humble like him, i like to be quiet 
  inquisitive like him about any random topic. He religius leader of out room. He has knowledge in almost all realms of hinduism due to which i learn a lot.
   He feels shy to talk to girls and so we have decided to make him once dance with a girl.

<p>
  Secondly i am blessed with Mukul, very supportive and humble guy. I like his way of being calm and composed even with zero preparation just before exam.
  I like his habit to reading books. He is fitness FREAK guy of our room including Shivam. I love his perception concept.
  He is a guy who taught me to follow to one target in which i am interested rather than multitasking. I am highly impressed by his ability 
  to get out of his darkest phase of life with a ever cute smiling face.

  Finally , Money Bhai or Problem solver, Decision maker and Chief health adviser our room is Shivam Ranjan. I am greatly influenced by 
  his ability to work hard as fuck for his goal during exams. Whenever i feel confused, he is always there for me, whenever i have fever he always guides
  and medicate me for which i am heartly gratful. Sometimes we have healtht debates as a result of which i grow in knowledge. 
  He is a guy who taught me to work for a bigger cause. He is very humble and helps me during exams a lot.
